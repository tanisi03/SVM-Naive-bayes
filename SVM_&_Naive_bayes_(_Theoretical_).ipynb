        "1. Objective: SVM's goal is to find a hyperplane (or decision boundary) that best separates data points from different classes. It tries to draw the line (or higher-dimensional surface) that maximizes the distance between the classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.Margin: SVM focuses on the margin, which is the space between the decision boundary and the closest data points from either class. The larger the margin, the better the model is at generalizing to new, unseen data.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.Support Vectors: These are the data points that are closest to the decision boundary. They are called support vectors because they \"support\" or define the position of the hyperplane. Only these points matter for the decision boundary; the others are not influential.\n",
        "\n",
        "4.Linear Separability: For data that can be perfectly separated into distinct classes with a straight line (or hyperplane in higher dimensions), SVM will find the hyperplane that maximizes the margin.\n",
        "\n",
        "5.Soft Margin (for noisy or overlapping data): If the data is not perfectly separable, SVM allows for some misclassifications by introducing flexibility. It will still try to maximize the margin but allow for some data points to be on the wrong side of the boundary, with a penalty for each mistake.\n",

        "3. Identifying Support Vectors: The Lagrange multipliers also help identify which data points are support vectors. Only the support vectors (the points closest to the decision boundary) will have non-zero Lagrange multipliers.

        "\n",
        "1. Feature Independence: Naïve Bayes assumes that all features (input variables) are independent of each other given the class label. This is the \"naïve\" part of the algorithm, as in reality, features are often correlated.\n",
        "\n",

        "These assumptions simplify the calculations of probabilities in the classification process, making Naïve Bayes computationally efficient. However, while the feature independence assumption is often unrealistic, Naïve Bayes still performs surprisingly well, especially in tasks like text classification (e.g., spam filtering) where features like words are often treated as independent."

        "\n",
        "#1. Simplicity and Speed:\n",
        "• Naïve Bayes is easy to understand and implement. It is a fast algorithm, both in terms of training and prediction, making it suitable for large datasets.\n",
        "\n",
        "#2. Efficient with High Dimensional Data:\n",
        "• It performs well with high-dimensional datasets, such as text classification problems (e.g., spam detection), where there are many features (words) and relatively few data points.\n",
        "\n",
        "#3. Works Well with Small Data:\n",
        "• Naïve Bayes often performs well even when the dataset is small, making it ideal for situations where labeled data is limited.\n",
        "\n",
        "#4. Requires Fewer Resources:\n",
        "• The algorithm has low computational and memory requirements compared to more complex models like neural networks or support vector machines.\n",
        "\n",
        "#5. Handles Missing Data:\n",

        "##Disadvantages of Naïve Bayes:\n",
        "\n",
        "#1. Feature Independence Assumption:\n",
        "• The biggest limitation of Naïve Bayes is the naïve assumption of independence between features. In real-world data, features are often correlated, which can lead to suboptimal performance when this assumption is violated.\n",
        "\n",
        "#2. Poor Performance with Highly Correlated Features:\n",

        "\n",
        "#3. Limited to Linear Decision Boundaries:\n",
        "• Naïve Bayes is not suitable for complex classification tasks with non-linear decision boundaries. It is generally a simpler model compared to more flexible algorithms like decision trees or SVMs.\n",
        "\n",
        "#4. Sensitivity to Data Imbalance:\n",
        "• If the dataset has highly imbalanced classes, Naïve Bayes might be biased towards the more frequent class unless the model is adjusted (e.g., with class priors).\n",
